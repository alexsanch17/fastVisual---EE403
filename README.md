// Overview // 

fastVisual is a real-time audio visualizer created for an NXP LPCXpresso54608 Development Board. fastVisual takes advantage
of the color LCD capacitve touch screen to allow user-friendly navigation of the user interface. The user can navigate the four screens
by tapping any of the corners of the LCD touch screen. Our project features 2 unique visualizers that display audio entering the 
digital microphone of the board in cool, interesting ways. Project also features an Equalizer screen that allows the user to change the
intensity values of the input samples as well as the values of low, middle, and high frequency bands which correspond to 
respective colors on the visualizers.
